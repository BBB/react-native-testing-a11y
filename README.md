Some tools to make testing and accessibilty play a bit nicer
</p>

### TODO

- [ ] Application of correct testID props for platform
- [ ] Application of correct a11y props for platform
- [ ] A11y/ test props can be mutually exclusive
- [ ] Alert when props are used on non-compatible Element
- [ ] Switch a11y/test prop values base on environment
- [ ] Ability to stack prefixes to testIDs to make them unique
- [ ] Ability to have a list of items in the same "class" of testID
- [ ] Map testID to UUID to ensure uniqueness
- [ ] Utility to read testIDs from simulator (can then be consumed by testing code)
